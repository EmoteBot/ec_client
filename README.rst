	my_user_id = client.login()
	# it returns the user ID associated with your token

	emote = client.emote('Think')
	emote.name  # Think

	emote.edit(name='Think_', description='a real happy thinker')
	# remove the description:
	emote.edit(description=None)

		gamewisp_emote.delete()

	all_emotes = client.emotes()
	popular_emotes = client.popular()

	client.close()

	# it's also a context manager:
	with aioec.Client(token=my_token) as client:
		client.delete('Think_')
	# this will automatically close the client
